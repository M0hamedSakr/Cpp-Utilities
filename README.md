# C++ Practice Utilities & Client Data Handling

This repository contains a collection of **C++ practice functions and mini-utilities** focused on:
- Arrays and matrices
- Strings manipulation
- File handling
- Structs and vectors
- Searching, splitting, joining, and updating data

The project is mainly for **learning and practicing core C++ concepts** through real examples.
